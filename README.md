This is meant to be a portfolio piece to illustrate OOP and serialization in a practical context.
To understand how to use this app honestly just look at the code, but I'll attempt to explain the controls for convenience:

To place a marker on the map, click the desired button followed by the desired location on the map.
To remove a marker, click it followed by its corresponding button.
To revert from remove to add functionality, long-click the corresponding button.

Markers append relative to the selected (enlarged, translucent) marker.
Markers remove relative to the selected (enlarged, translucent) marker.

The app should guide you through saving and loading but it might have some quirks.
Honestly just wanted an excuse to play with serialization after I was finished with markers.

Hope you enjoy. I was able to draw many happy and sad faces with this :D
